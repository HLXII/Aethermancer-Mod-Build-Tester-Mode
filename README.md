# Aethermancer-Mod-Build-Tester-Mode

Adds a new Build Tester Mode setting in the Accessibility page. Enabling this will provide the following changes:
* Skill Rerolls will be free and infinite
* Monster Shrines will have all Monster Mementos obtained available.
  * They will still require Monster Souls to rebirth a Monster
  
# Build
Building locally requires various `.dll` files to be added to the `lib` directory. These files can be obtained from Bepinex and the data within `Aethermancer_Data/Managed`.

# Installation
Install [Bepinex](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx). 

After, add the `.dll` from the latest releases to the `BepInEx\plugins` directory.
